## Project Overview

This is my first project after following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) HTML curriculum. It’s built **entirely in HTML**—no CSS or JavaScript—so I leaned on deprecated tags for styling and on image-editing tools for a bit of flair.

- **Aesthetics first**: I used `<font>` and the `bgcolor` attribute to control typography and background colour.
- **Custom header image**: Photoshopped The Odin Project logo onto Gordon Ramsay’s face (source: mydecorative.com), added the “Odin Recipes” text in Canva, then hosted it via Cloudinary.


## What I Learned

During this build, I explored and applied several HTML elements, attributes and entities for the first time:

- `<font size="">`  
- `<body bgcolor="">`  
- `<a style="color:;">`  
- `<a style="text-decoration:none">`  
- `&nbsp` 
- `<br>`
